#### Q: What is the ESCC?

The ESCC is a silicon carbide crucible for THC vaping. It is designed to work exclusively with the AVS Molecule 22 (M22) atomizer.

#### Q: What do the numbers written on my ESCC package mean?

 * Resistance: Every ESCC has a unique resistance. This "cold resistance" is the value your mod should read when the ESCC has been properly installed.
 * Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR): For V1 ESCCs, the TCR is calculated from your resistance. For V2 ESCCs, the TCR is calibrated by AVS.

#### Q: What versions of the ESCC exist?

The "original" ESCC was manufactured in 2018 and 2019. The "interim" ESCC was manufactured in 2019. The [V1 ESCC](/escc/v1) was manufactured between 2019 and 2020. The [V2 ESCC](/escc/v2) has been manufactured since late 2020. The V2 ESCC is almost 25% larger and uses a different SiC formulation, meaning it has different thermal and electrical properties compared to the V1.

Additionally, there are both "in-spec" and "out-of-spec" V1 ESCCs. V1 ESCCs with a resistance under 1.0 Ohm are considered "in-spec," and generally have a TCR above 80. V1 ESCCs with a resistance greater than 1.0 Ohm are considered "out-of-spec" (OOS) and have a TCR below 80. OOS ESCCs are not sold as TC-capable, but you can get TC working with the right settings.

#### Q: What mods work with the ESCC?

The best mod for the ESCC is the [Control Tower](/control-tower) from AVS. Because it is a first-party device, everything works out of the box and as it should.

The next best device to get would be one using an [Evolv DNA](/evolv-dna) board. All modern DNA boards will provide sufficient power for the ESCC and have above-average temperature control (TC) capability.

The next best device to get would be compatible with [Arctic Fox](/arctic-fox) firmware. Arctic Fox is a third-party firmware for specific Joyetech/Wismec/Eleaf devices which provides above-average TC.

The next best device to get would have TC and a maximum output power of at least 50W.
